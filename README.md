# GitHub Desktop App UI
I built this as a portfolio item so show off my User Interface building skills using React Js.

## Tech:
Create React App
React Icons

## Showcasing:
My ability to quickly build UI/UX experiences in the browser.

## Notes
This is a non interactive example, I'm going to build out a few more UI interfaces for my portfolio and then come back and add interactive features as needed.
