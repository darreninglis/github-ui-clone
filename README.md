# GitHub Desktop App UI

I built this as a portfolio item to show off my User Interface building skills using React Js.

Live demo can be viewed [here](https://github-desktop-ui-clone.netlify.app/)

## Tech:

Create React App
React Icons

## Showcasing:

My ability to quickly build UI/UX experiences in the browser.

## Notes

This is a non interactive example, I'm going to build out a few more UI interfaces for my portfolio and then come back and add interactive features as needed.
